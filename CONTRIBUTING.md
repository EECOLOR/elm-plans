## Design Discussions

Issue comments are excellent at finding "this seems not so good" and "how about this idea?" That said, issue comments are *not* good at bringing these things all together in a coherent way. Without curation, good ideas can get lost and it becomes tricky to turn them into concrete and productive action.

So productive comments on a design discussion include things like:

  * Concrete examples that may pose problems
  * Concerns about learning, efficiency, etc.
  * Ideas of how to do things in a nicer way

As progress is made on these, the original description should be updated to the latest state of affairs.
  
Even with that curration, the danger is that things spirals out of control, leaving an issue with tons of comments that are difficult to follow. This is especially bad if someone comes back months later to an issue that is 50 comments long. When a discussion enters this death spiral, the next steps are:

  1. Close the issue.
  2. Create a meta issue that:
      - links to the old issue
      - summarizes any unanswered questions
  3. Any potential alternative ideas are turned into issues describing the alternative completely. The originator of the idea should do this.
  4. As alternatives come into existence:
      - edit the root comment in the meta issue to link to the alternative
      - close the issue describing the alternative, but continue discussion of specifics there

So the goal here is to break the problem down into coherent subparts and organize things such that someone can quickly understand the problem and the state of affairs within that realm.

# Elm Plans

A central home for future plans for [Elm](http://elm-lang.org).


## Feature Requests

When you want a new feature to the language or core tools, open an issue here
proposing the idea.


## Collaborate

We have a nice list of [projects](https://github.com/elm-lang/projects) that
would work great as community projects!


## Roadmap

A rough prioritization of features that are planned and discussed.
